There are my personal repository for my scripts to Bot of Legends.

### Issues

We use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/bolchallengers/bol/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meaningful for an issue (e.g. "+1"). If you'd like for an issue to be fixed faster, you should either fix it yourself and submit a pull request, or place a bounty on the issue.
